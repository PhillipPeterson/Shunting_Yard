Not sure if it's the greatest idea but to save on number of files
I grouped similar tests into the same files so:

test_isdigitnumber includes tests for isDigit and isNumber

test_operatorbracket includes tests for isOperator, isLeftBracket, and isRightBracket

test_stack includes tests for stackIsEmpty, peekAtStack, popFromStack, and pushToStack
